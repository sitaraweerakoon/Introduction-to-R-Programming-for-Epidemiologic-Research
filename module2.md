## Introduction to Technologies

Now that students know how the course is laid out, we start introducing the various technologies/tools for managing and analyzing data that we will use in this course. In this module, the intent is not to actually teach data management or analysis techniques. Itâ€™s just about how to access the various software we will use. We will not go into the details of how to use these.


`topics`

- R/Studio

- Google Docs

- Git

- GitHub

- Why R?
 
    - Students often ask me about the difference between R and other software commonly used for data analysis (e.g. SPSS, Stata, SAS, Python). Additionally, many students often wonder why we chose to teach this course using R, as opposed to some other program. I think that the web article, The popularity of data analysis software gives some information that is really useful for addressing both of these questions. So your first, and frankly one of the only, reading assignments in this course is this article. Please click the [button](www.google.com) below to be ready to discuss in our first lab session.

- S

- Stack Overflow

- Slack (Asana?)

- Finding answers

- Introduce help pages and resources


`learning objectives`

- Summarize the key features of R/Studio
